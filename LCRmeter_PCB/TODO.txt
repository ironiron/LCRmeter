add protection diode on VCC output
add separate VCC input on 5v, or sth? from USB probably?, and then check if power comes from usb or batterry
22 ohm usb resistor might be reduced to only 0r jumper
connect negative terminal to GND instead of 1V5, as it's to complicated unneccesarry (but 1v5 may stay)
